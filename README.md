# SPOJ C++ Solutions

This repository contains solutions to various problems from the [Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ)](http://www.spoj.com/), implemented in C++.

## Introduction

SPOJ is an online platform offering a vast collection of algorithmic challenges across different topics. It's a great place to hone your coding and algorithmic skills. Here, I share my solutions in C++ to some of the problems I've tackled.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jhonathannicolas/spoj-cpp-solutions.git
```
2. Navigate to the problem's directory:
```bash
cd spojcpp/[CATEGORY]/[PROBLEM_NAME]
```
3. Compile the C++ file:
```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -o solution main.cpp
```
4. Run the solution:
```bash
./solution
```

## Structure

Each problem has its own directory named after its SPOJ problem code. Within each directory, you'll find:

- A C++ file named _main.cpp_ containing the solution.
- A `README.md` detailing the problem statement and constraints.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you have a solution to a problem that's not yet in this repository, or a better/optimized solution, feel free to open a pull request.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch for your solution: `git checkout -b new-solution`.
3. Add your solution and commit: `git commit -m "Added solution for PROBLEM_NAME"`.
4. Push to your fork: `git push origin new-solution`.
5. Open a pull request from your fork to this repository.
